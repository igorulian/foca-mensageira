# How it works
 The user sends in the DM in the bot the information needed for the message (Anonymous: yes/no, to: @user and message).
 
 If the message template is correct, the BOT responds with a confirmation message for the user to confirm the information.
 
 So, if the information is all correct, the user confirms and the bot puts the message in the list of tweets.
 
 When the tweet arrives, the bot will tweet to all followers the message sent by the user with the desired information
